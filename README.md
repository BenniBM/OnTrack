## 🚀 What's This All About?

Ever set a goal and then completely forgot about it until the night before? Yeah, we've all been there. OnTrack is like having a personal coach who's actually good at math – it shows you exactly how far behind (or ahead!) you are on your goals.

## ✨ Features That'll Make You Go "Wow!"

- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Watch your progress climb
- ⏰ **Smart Deadlines**: Because "someday" is not a real date
- 📈 **Expected Progress**: See where you should be (no sugar coating!)
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI**: Easy on the eyes, like a sunset (but more productive)
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices (yes, even your smart fridge)

## 🎮 Show Me The Magic!
